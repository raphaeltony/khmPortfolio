        <h2 class="display-1 mb-5">About</h2>
        <p class="lead">14 years ago, I realized that we humans have the closest thing to a superpower. In 2006, I got my hands on a PC for the first time. Ever since, I’ve been drawn to the endless wonders of the World of Computers; from programming microcontrollers to implementing Blockchain.</p>
        <p>In 11th grade, I enrolled for India’s largest MOOC - Introduction to Modern Application Development (IMAD). After the final exam, Hasura Technologies selected me for an Online Product Development Fellowship; a chance to work with people around India just blew my mind! We were put into groups of 3 and using ‘React Native’, I worked on the front-end of creating an app. This was my entry into the world of web development.</p>
        <p>In all these activities, my love for technology just grew exponentially and I’ve picked up other programming languages like C++, Python, SQL and JavaScript</p>
        <p>In 2018, I was elected as the Head Boy of the Choice School. Being the school leader taught me the importance of delegating work and managing time. In the wake of the tragic Kerala floods of 2018, we transformed our school campus into a 3-day Collection Centre where people would drop supplies and we would take these supplies to needy relief camps.</p>
        <p>So, I have come a long way from where I have started, growing more in my passion and at the same time picking up essential skills like leadership and teamwork. Right now, I am a first year CSE Student at the Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kakkanad.</p>
